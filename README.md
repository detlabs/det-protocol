# DET Protocol

Decentralized Thing (DET) protocol is a fully decentralized device communication protocol on Ethereum. Users can manage DET devices through dapps and share DET devices to earn DET tokens. By staking DET tokens, users can receive more DET tokens from airdrops and vote on the DET device design.

## DET Token

A DET token is an ERC-20 token in Ethereum.

## DET Device

A DET device can be represented as an ERC-721 (Non-Fungible) token on Ethereum and can communicate with DET dapps wirelessly.

## DET Dapps

DET dapps are decentralized apps for DET users to connect to the DET network and manage DET devices.

## DET Network

DET network includes decentralized blockchain network (Ethereum) and decentralized storage network (IPFS).

## DET Owner

A DET owner is a DET user who initializes a DET device using the DET dapps. A DET owner can authorize/share DET devices on DET Network.

## DET Authorizer

A DET authorizer is a DET user who gains access to DET devices.

## DET Guest

A DET guest is a DET user who requests access to DET devices.
